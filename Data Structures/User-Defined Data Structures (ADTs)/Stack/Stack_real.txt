Stack_real is just a stack but implemented like std::stack that is built-in C++.

// Here in this ADT , Stack is designed like a container adapter that doesn't manages its memory itself like the built-in one.
// We have implemented in such a way that our stack works like that of vector , list , deque like the built-in one.
// For that we use a technique called template template parameters.
